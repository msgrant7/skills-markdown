# Index.md File
## Created as part of the GitHub Markdown lesson.
### It was empty, but MG added this explanation or contents.
1) Committed it initially to the 'start-markdown' branch in 'skills-markdown.
2) Did a Pull Request to compare to existing 'main' branch.
3) Did the 'Commit Changes' in order to Merge this updated file to 'main.'
4) After the successul Pull Request and Merge-Commit, GitHub offered to DELETE
   this 'start-markdown' branch since it was empty now and had served its
   purpose.  Opted to delete, as recommended.
