# Index.md File
## Created as part of the GitHub Markdown lessons.
### It was empty, but MG added this explanation or contents.
Had to use Markdown Ref: [Getting started writing on github](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax.md)

1) Committed this file initially to the 'start-markdown' branch in 'skills-markdown' repo.
2) Did a Pull Request to compare to existing 'main' branch in the repository.
3) Did the 'Commit Changes' in order to Merge this updated file to 'main.'
4) After the successul Pull Request and Merge-Commit, GitHub offered to DELETE
   the 'start-markdown' branch since it was empty now and had served its
   purpose.  Opted to delete, as recommended.

5) Added an image to the Markdown file as follows:
 
   ![Image of Octacat_Surfer](/assets/Octacat_Surfer.png)
   <!-- ![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/surftocat.png) -->

   Also added an 'assets' folder to store my own uploaded (smaller) Octacat_Surfer image vs. getting an image from the web.  
   - The 'assets' folder was first added to a temporary 'nested-lists-br' branch, which I deleted after merging the updated index.md file, AND the
    new 'assets' folder, with the 'main' branch in this repository.
    - Merge works for both files and folders.  Good!
      
7) Learning nested lists with multiple levels:
     
   A top-of-list item:  
   - 1st level nested line
        - 2nd level nested line
